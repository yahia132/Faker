        <h3><p>"T1" team is one of the most famous and oldest teams in the history of the game "League of Legends" and yet it captured the hearts of fans and other teams and it is the one that made the game famous on the world level in terms of achievements, championships and names of players throughout the history of the team and of course the most famous of them is one player, "Faker", who won "5" World Cups and was the youngest person to win the World Cup and was the oldest at the same time. Faker devoted his whole life to playing this game and he is still the true best player who has appeared in this game throughout the history of the game's release and I am one of his biggest fans. I really hope that Faker will remain forever because he is the only person who made me love this difficult and exciting game.</p></h3>
